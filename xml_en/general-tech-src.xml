        <description>
          <p>The objective of this technique is to provide a mechanism to bypass blocks of material that are repeated on multiple Web pages by skipping directly to the main content of the Web page. The first interactive item in the Web page is a link to the beginning of the main content. Activating the link sets focus beyond the other content to the main content. This technique is most useful when a Web page has one main content area, rather than a set of content areas that are equally important, and when there are not multiple navigation sections on the page.</p>
          <note>
          	<p diff="chg">It is preferable for links to be visible at all times, since users navigating via the keyboard include switch users, those using techniques that generate keyboard strokes slowly, screen magnification software users, screen reader users working with sighted colleagues, keyboard only users and those navigating using voice recognition software. However, <loc href="navigation-mechanisms-skip" linktype="guideline">Success Criterion 2.4.1</loc> does not require that they be visible when they do not have focus, and links that are visible only when they have focus can meet this success criterion.</p>

            <head>An online newspaper</head>
            <description>
              <p>An on-line newspaper contains many sections of information: a search function, a corporate banner, sidebars, minor stories, how to contact the newspaper, etc. The lead story is located in the middle of the page. The first link that the user reaches when tabbing through the page is titled "Skip to Lead Story". Activating the link moves visual focus to the story. Pressing tab again takes the user to the first link in the main story.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to provide a way to pause movement or scrolling of content. If the user needs to pause the movement, to reduce distraction or to have time to read it, they can do so, and then restart it as needed. This mechanism can be provided either through interactive controls that conform to WCAG or through keyboard shortcuts. If keyboard shortcuts are used, they are documented.</p>

        <description>
          <p>The objective of this technique is to provide a second version of video content that provides extended audio desc<phrase diff="add">r</phrase>iptions. One of the difficult things about creating traditional audio descriptions is that the narrator sometimes has to provide a lot of information during very short pauses in dialogue. Extended audio description temporarily pauses the audio and video to allow critical information to be delivered when pauses in dialogue are insufficient for adequate description.</p>
          <p>Providing a second version of the movie with extended audio descriptions will make this content accessible for blind people who need to hear not only the dialogue but also the context and other aspects of the video that are not communicated by the characters' dialogue alone, and for which there is insufficient time during the natural dialogue.</p>
          <p>Because it disrupts viewing for those who do not need the additional description, techniques that allow you to turn the feature on and off are often provided. Alternately, versions with and without the additional description can be provided.</p>

        <examples>
          <eg-group>
            <description>
              <p>An alternate version of an online video of a family escaping from a burning building, there is a continuous dialogue between the husband and wife about where the children are. Meanwhile, in the background, a wall caves in<phrase diff="del">, which</phrase><phrase diff="add">. This</phrase> is important information in the story because it will block their exit from that part of the building. The video track halts (same frame is repeated) while a narrator gives the details about the wall falling and the video continues.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to allow users who cannot hear to be able
            to access real-time synchronized media broadcasts. It is more difficult to create
            accurate real-time captions because there is little time to correct mistakes
            or to listen a second time or consult someone to be sure the words are
            accurately reproduced. It is also harder to simplify or paraphrase
            information if it is flowing too quickly.</p>
          <p>Real-time typing text entry techniques exist using stenographic and rapid
            typing technologies. Re-voicing speech-to-text (where a person listens to
            speech and then carefully re-voices it into a computer trained to their
            speech) is used today for telephone relay services and may be used in the
            future for captioning. Eventually speech-to-text with correction will be
            possible.</p>

          <p>Sometimes content is not created using markup language but rather using a
            programming language or tools. In many cases, these technologies have
            interface components that are already programmed to interface with
            accessibility APIs. If an author uses these components and fills in the
            properties (e.g., name, etc.) the resulting user interface components in the
            content will be accessible to assistive technology.</p>
          <p>However, if an author wants to create a user interface component that is new
            and they cannot use standard components, then they need to be sure to add
            the accessibility provisions themselves - and implement them in a way that
            is compatible with the accessibility API.</p>
          <p>After completion, the custom component should be tested for Accessibility Support.</p>

              <p>A Web page uses java to create an applet. A group of
                authors wants to create an entirely new type of interface component
                so they cannot use existing Java objects. They use Java swing classes
                to create their component because the Java swing classes already
                have provisions for connecting to different accessibility APIs.
                Using the Java swing classes they are able to create an interface
                component that exposes its name and role, is able to be set by AT
                and alerts AT to any updates.</p>

              <p>A Web page uses an original ActiveX control that is

                expose information about accept commands. The control then interacts
                directly with assistive technology running the user agent on systems
                that support MSAA.</p>

          <p>Blinking content can be created using a variety of technologies, many of which include options to loop blinking content continuously or to otherwise specify the amount of time the blinking content is displayed. Limiting the blinking of content to five seconds minimizes the distraction that blinking can cause.

            context. Because changing the value of a form control does not typically

          <p>The objective of this technique is to make sure that users can read text
            that is presented over a background. This technique goes beyond the 4.5:1
            contrast technique to provide a higher level of contrast to make it easier
            for people with low vision to read.</p>
          <p>If the background is a solid color (or all black or all white) then the
            contrast ratio of the text can be maintained by making sure that each
            of the text letters have a 7:1 contrast ratio with the background.</p>
          <p>If the background or the letters vary in relative luminance (or are patterned), then
            the background around the letters can be chosen or shaded so that the
            letters maintain a 7:1contrast ratio with the background behind them
            even if they do not have that contrast ratio with the entire background.</p>
          <p>The contrast ratio can sometimes be maintained by changing the
            relative luminance of the letters as the relative luminance of the background changes across
            the page.</p>
          <p>Another method is to provide a halo around the text that provides the
            necessary contrast ratio if the background image or color would not
            normally be sufficiently different in relative luminance.</p>

              <p>Text is placed over a picture of the college campus.
                Since a wide variety of colors and darknesses appear in the picture
                the area behind the text is fogged white so that the picture is very
                faint and the maximum darkness is still light enough to maintain a
                7:1 contrast ratio with the black text written over the picture.</p>

        <description>
          <p>The objective of this technique is to make sure that users can read text
            that is presented over a background. For Success Criterion 1.4.3, this technique describes the minimum contrast ratio for text that is less than 18 point (if not bold) and less than 14 point (if bold). For Success Criterion 1.4.5, this technique relaxes the 7:1 contrast ratio requirement  for text that is at least 18 point (if not bold) or at least 14 point (if bold).</p>
          <p>If the background is a solid color (or all black or all white) then the
            relative luminance of the text can be maintained by making sure that each
            of the text letters have 4.5:1 contrast ratio with the background.</p>
          <p>If the background or the letters vary in relative luminance (or are patterned) then
            the background around the letters can be chosen or shaded so that the
            letters maintain a 4.5:1 contrast ratio with the background behind them
            even if they do not have that contrast ratio with the entire background.</p>
          <p>For example, if a letter is lighter at the top than it is a the bottom, it may be difficult to maintain the contrast ratio between the letter and the background over the full letter. In this case, the designer might darken the background behind the letter, or add a thin black outline (at least one pixel wide) around the letter in order to keep the contrast ratio between the letter and the background above 4.5:1.</p>
          <p>The contrast ratio can sometimes be maintained by changing the
            relative luminance of the letters as the relative luminance of the background changes across
            the page.</p>
          <p>For example, if a page is very light on one edge and fades to very dark on the other edge, there is no color that can run across the page and meet the contrast guidelines on both edges. One way of addressing this would be to change the lightness of the letters as well so that each letter always meets the contrast ratio for the background that is immediately behind the letter.</p>
          <p>Another method is to provide a halo around the text that provides the
            necessary contrast ratio if the background image or color would not
            normally be sufficiently different in relative luminance.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to avoid flashing at rates that are known to cause seizures if the flashes are bright and large enough. Since some users may be using screen enlargers, this technique limits the flashing of any size content to no more than three flashes in any 1-second period.</p>
          <note>
            <p>This technique is stricter than the Level A Success Criteria but is easier to test and can be used to meet the Level A Success Criteria because all failure thresholds in the Level A Success Criteria involve flashing 3.5 flashes or more within one second. Most content does not flash at all and even content that blinks does not blink this fast except on rare occasions.  Therefore, in order to avoid having to carry out the more complex testing specified by the Success Criteria, one could follow this technique to ensure that content only flashes one, two, or at most three times in any 1-second period.</p>
            <p>Regarding 3.5 Flashes; if there are seven transitions from dark to light or light to dark, it would be 3.5 flashes, which is more than the allowed three flashes (six transitions).</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to ensure that keyboard users do not become trapped in a subset of the content that can only be exited using a mouse or pointing device. A common example is content rendered by plug-ins. Plug-ins are user agents that render content inside the user agent host window and respond to all user actions that takes place while the plug-in has the focus. If the plug-in does not provide a keyboard mechanism to return focus to the parent window, users who must use the keyboard may become trapped in the plug-in content.</p>
          <p>This problem can be avoided by using one of the following mechanisms to provide a way for users to escape the subset of the content:</p>
          <ulist>
            <item>
              <p>Ensuring that the keyboard function for advancing focus within content (commonly the tab key) exits the subset of the content after it reaches the final navigation location.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
              <p>Providing a keyboard function to move the focus out of the subset of the content. Be sure to document the feature in an accessible manner within the subset.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
              <p>If the technology used in the subset of the content natively provides a "move to parent" keyboard command, documenting that command before the user enters the plug-in so they know how to get out again.</p>
            </item>
          </ulist>
          <p>If the author uses a technology that allows users to enter the sub-content with keyboard and does not allow users to exit the sub-content with keyboard by default (i.e., it is not a feature of the Web content technology or its user agents) then, in order to implement this technique the author would either build such a capability into their content or not use the technology.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to identify the purpose of a link from the link and its sentence context. The sentence enclosing the link provides context for an otherwise unclear link. The description lets a user distinguish this link from links in the Web page that lead to other destinations and helps the user determine whether to follow the link. Note that simply providing the URI of the destination is generally not sufficiently descriptive.</p>
          <note>
            <p>These descriptions will be most useful to the user if the additional information needed to understand the link precedes the link. If the additional information follows the link, there can be confusion and difficulty for screen reader users who are reading through the page in order (top to bottom).</p>

                <loc href="http://example.com">click here</loc>."</p>
              <p>Although the link phrase 'click here' is not sufficient to understand the link, the information needed precedes the link in the same sentence.</p>

        <description>
          <p>The objective of this technique is to allow users who cannot hear or read text rapidly to be able to access synchronized media material.</p>
          <p>For those who communicate primarily in sign language it is sometimes less preferable and sometimes not possible for them to read and understand text at the rate it is presented in captions.   For these latter individuals it is important to provide sign language presentation of the audio information.</p>
          <p>One universally compatible way of doing this is to simply embed a video of the sign language interpreter in the video stream.   This has the disadvantage of providing a lower resolution image that cannot be easily enlarged without enlarging the entire image.</p>
          <note>
            <p>If the video stream is too small, the sign language interpreter will be indiscernible. When creating a video steam that includes a video of a sign language interpreter, make sure there is a mechanism to play the video stream full screen in the accessibility-supported content technology. Otherwise, be sure the interpreter portion of the video is adjustable to the size it would be had the entire video stream been full screen.</p>
            <p>Since sign language is not usually a signed version of the printed language, the author has to decide which sign language to include.  Usually the sign language of the primary audience would be used.  If intended for multiple audiences, multiple sign languages may be used.  Refer to advisory techniques for multiple sign languages.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to ensure that the order of content presented to assistive technologies allows the user to make sense of the content. Some techniques permit the content to be rendered visually in a meaningful sequence even if this is different from the order in which the content is encoded in the underlying source file.</p>
          <p>For example, when mixing languages with different directionality in HTML, the bidirectional algorithm may position punctuation in the wrong location in the visual rendering. The visual rendering problem could be corrected by moving the punctuation in the content stream so that the bidirectional algorithm positions it as desired, but this would expose the incorrect content order to assistive technology. The content is both rendered in the correct order visually and exposed to assistive technology in the correct order by using markup to override the bidirectional algorithm.</p>
          <p>When rendered visually, white space characters such a space or tab may not appear to be part of the content. However, when inserted into the content to control visual formatting, they may interfere with the meaning of the content.</p>
          <p>At a larger granularity, controlling the placement of blocks of content in an HTML document using layout tables may produce a rendering in which related information is positioned together visually, but separated in the content stream. Since layout tables are read row by row, if the caption of an illustration is placed in the row following the illustration, it may be impossible to associate the caption with the image.</p>

              <p>A Web page from a museum exhibition contains a navigation bar containing a long list of links. The page also contains an image of one of the pictures from the exhibition, a heading for the picture, and a detailed description of the picture. The links in the navigation bar form a meaningful sequence. The heading, image, and text of the description also form a meaningful sequence. CSS is used to position the elements on the page.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to ensure that interactive elements receive focus in an order that follows sequences and relationships in the content. When designing the content, the interactive elements such as links and form controls are placed in the content so that the default tab order follows the sequences and relationships in the content. Each technology defines its default tab order, so the mechanism for placing the controls in the content will depend on the technology used.</p>
          <p>As an example, in HTML, the default focus order follows the order in which elements appear in the content source. When the order of the HTML source matches the visual order of the Web page, tabbing through the content follows the visual layout of the content. When the source order does not match the visual order, the tab order through the content must reflect the logical relationships in the content that are displayed visually.</p>

              <p>A form contains two, side-by-side sections of information. One section contains information about an applicant; the other section contains information about the applicant's spouse. All the interactive elements in the applicant section receive focus before any of the elements in the spouse section.

            readers due to interference by the content sound. It also allows the author
            to avoid putting controls on the Web page to control the sound - and the problem
            faced by users with screen readers in finding the control (when unable

          <p>The technique is simple. The sound plays for 3 or less seconds and stops

          <p>The objective of this technique is to make content easier to use by making
            the placement of repeated components more predictable. This technique helps
            maintain consistent layout or presentation between Web pages by presenting components that are repeated in these Web  units in the same relative order each time they appear. Other
            components can be inserted between them, but their relative order is not
            changed.</p>
          <p>This technique also applies to navigational components that are repeated.
            Web pages often contain a navigation menu or other
            navigational component that allows the user to jump to other Web pages. This technique makes the placement of navigational
            components more predictable by presenting the links or programmatic
            references inside a navigational component in the same relative order each
            time the navigational component is repeated. Other links can be removed or
            inserted between the existing ones, for example to allow navigation inside a
            subsection of a set of Web pages, but the relative order is not
            changed.</p>

              <p>A Web site has a logo, a title, a search form and a navigation bar
                at the top of each page; these appear in the same relative order on
                each page where they are repeated. On one page the search form is
                missing but the other items are still in the same order.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
              <p>A Web site has a left-hand navigation menu with links to the major
                sections of the site. When the user follows a link to another
                section of the site, the links to the major sections appear in the

                other links are added, but the other links always stay in the same
                relative order. For example, on a Web site of a company that sells
                products and offers training, when a user moves from the section on
                products to the section on training, the links to individual
                products are removed from the navigation list, while links to
                training offerings are added.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to make the definition of a word, phrase, or abbreviation available by providing the definition in a glossary. A glossary is an alphabetical list of words, phrases, and abbreviations with their definitions. Glossaries are most appropriate when the words, phrases, and abbreviations used within the content relate to a specific discipline or technology area. A glossary can also provide the pronunciation of a word or phrase.</p>
          <p>The glossary is included at the end of the Web page or the glossary is located via one of the mechanisms for locating content within a set of Web pages. (See
            <loc href="navigation-mechanisms-mult-loc" linktype="understanding">Understanding Success Criterion 2.4.5</loc>.)</p>
          <p>If the glossary contains several definitions for the same word, phrase, or abbreviation, simply providing the glossary is not sufficient to satisfy this Success Criterion.  A different technique should be used to find the correct definition. This is especially important if the uses of the word, phrase, or abbreviation are not unique within the Web page, that is, if different occurrences of the item have different definitions.</p>

          <p>This is one of a series of techniques for locating content that are sufficient for addressing Success Criterion 2.4.5. 
            A site map is a Web page that provides links to different sections of the site. To make the site map available within the site, at a minimum every page that is listed in the site map contains a link to the site map.</p>
          <p>The site map serves several purposes.</p>
          <ulist>
            <item>
              <p>It provides an overview of the entire site.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
              <p>It helps users understand what the site contains and how the content is organized.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
              <p>It offers an alternative to complex navigation bars that may be different at different parts of the site.</p>
            </item>
          </ulist>
          <p>There are different types of site maps. The simplest and most common kind of site map is an outline that shows links to each section or sub-site. Such outline views do not show more complex relationships within the site, such as links between pages in different sections of the site. The site maps for some large sites use headings that expand to show additional detail about each section.</p>
          <p>A site map describes the contents and organization of a site. It is important that site maps be updated whenever the site is updated. A Web page that does not link to all the sections of a site, that presents an organization that is different from the site's organization, or that contains links that are no longer valid is not a valid site map.</p>

          <p>This is one of a series of techniques for locating content that are sufficient for addressing Success Criterion 2.4.5. 
            A table of contents provides links to sections and subsections of the same document. The information in the document is usually organized hierarchically, and is intended to be read sequentially. Just as there could be many books in a library, each with its own table of contents, a Web site may contain many documents, each with its own table of contents.</p>
          <p>The table of contents serves two purposes:</p>
          <ulist>
            <item>
              <p>It gives users an overview of the document's contents and organization.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
              <p>It allows readers to go directly to a specific section of an on-line document.</p>
            </item>
          </ulist>
          <p>The table of contents typically includes only major sections of the document, though in some cases an expanded table of contents that provides a more detailed view of a complex document may be desirable.</p>
          <p>The sections of the document could be located on the same Web page or divided into multiple Web pages. A table of contents is particularly useful when a document is divided into multiple Web pages.</p>
          <p>There is a distinction between a table of contents and other Navigational elements such as a Navigation Bar or Site Map. A table of contents provides links to sections of the same document. Those sections could be located on the same Web page or spread across multiple Web pages. But together, they make a complete idea. To better understand this, consider a hard copy book which has sections. Each section belongs to the book. There could be many books in a library. In this example, the "library" is the entire Web site.</p>

                that is a hierarchical list of links to the sections and subsections of the document. The hierarchy of the table of contents reflects the organization of the sections, and each item in the table of contents is a link that takes the user directly to that section.</p>

          <p>A breadcrumb trail helps the user to visualize how content has been structured and how to navigate back to previous Web pages, and may identify the current location within a series of Web pages. A breadcrumb trail either displays locations in the path the user took to reach the Web page, or it displays the location of the current Web page within the organization of the site.</p>
          <p>Breadcrumb trails are implemented using links to the Web pages that have been accessed in the process of navigating to the current Web page. They are placed in the same location within each Web page in the set.</p>
          <p>It can be helpful to users to separate the items in the breadcrumb trailing with a visible separator. Examples of separators include "&gt;", "|", "/", and "::".</p>

          <p>The purpose of this technique is to provide an accessible alternative way of presenting the information in a synchronized media presentation.</p>
          <p>In a synchronized media presentation, information is presented in a variety of ways including<phrase diff="add">:</phrase></p>
          <ulist>
            <item>
              <p>dialogue,</p>
            </item>

              <p>sounds (natural and artificial),</p>
            </item>
            <item>
              <p>the setting and background,</p>
            </item>
            <item>
              <p>the actions and expressions of people, animals, etc.,</p>
            </item>
            <item>
              <p>text or graphics,</p>
            </item>
            <item>
              <p>and more.</p>
            </item>
          </ulist>
          <p>In order to present the same information in accessible form, this technique involves creating a document that tells the same story and presents the same information as the synchronized media.  Such a document is sometimes called a screenplay. It includes all the important dialogue and actions as well as descriptions of backgrounds etc. that are part of the story.</p>
          <p>If an actual screenplay was used to create the synchronized media in the first place, this can be a good place to start.  In production and editing however, the synchronized media usually changes from the screenplay.  For this technique, the original screenplay would be corrected to match the dialogue and what actually happens in the final edited form of the synchronized media.</p>
          <p>In addition, some special types of synchronized media include interaction that has to occur at particular places in the playing of the synchronized media.   Sometimes it may result in an action taking place (e.g., something is purchased, sent, done, etc.). Sometimes it may change the course of the synchronized media (e.g., the synchronized media has multiple paths that are determined by user input).  In those cases links or some other mechanism would be used in the alternative for time-based media to allow people using the alternative to be able to have the same options and abilities as those using the synchronized media.</p>

            <item>
              <p>A training film shows employees how to use a new piece of equipment.  It involves a person talking throughout while they demonstrate the operation.  The screenplay used to create the training film is used as a starting point. It is then edited and corrected to match the dialogue etc.  The film and the resulting alternative for time-based media are then made available on the company Web site. Employees can then use either or both to learn how to use the machine.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to provide the definition of words, phrases, jargon, or abbreviation expansions by adding a mechanism to access an on-line dictionary to the Web page. This technique uses existing resources on the Web to provide the definition rather than requiring the author to create a glossary or other mechanism within the site. By providing access from within the Web page, a user can easily locate the desired definition. This technique can only be used if the online dictionary returns the correct definition.</p>

The search would be performed against an on-line dictionary of computer terms, acronyms, and abbreviations. Since the dictionary is specialized for computer terms, the acronym expansion found should be more accurate than with a general dictionary.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to provide a way to link to remote long
            descriptions in technologies that do not have a long description feature
            built directly into them (e.g., longdesc) or where the feature is known to
            not be supported.</p>
          <p>With this technique, the long description is provided in another location
            than the non-text content. This could be at another location within the same
            URI or at another URI. A link to that long description is provided that is
            immediately adjacent to the non-text content. The link can be immediately
            before or after the non-text content. If the description is located along
            with other text then put "End of description" at the end so that they know
            when to stop reading and return to the main content. If a "Back" button will
            not take the person back to the point from which they jumped, then a link
            back to the non-text content location is provided.</p>
          <p>This technique was commonly used in HTML before 'longdesc' was added to the
            specification. In HTML it was called a D-Link because it was usually
            implemented by putting a D next to images and using the D as a link to the
            long description. This technique is not technology specific and can be used
            in any technology that supports links.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to provide a long description without
            requiring the user to jump off to another location for the description. It
            also allows all users to see the description which may be useful to anyone
            who might miss some features in the non-text content.</p>
          <p>With this technique, the long description is provided as part of the
            standard presentation (i.e., everyone receives it). The description is
            located near the non-text content but does not have to be the very next
            item. For example, there may be a caption under a chart with the long
            description provided in the following paragraph.</p>
          <p>The location of this long description is then provided within the short text
            alternative so the user knows where to look for it if they cannot view the
            non-text content.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to let the user control if and when
            content is updated, in order to avoid confusion or disorientation caused by
            automatic refreshes that cause a change of context. Users of screen readers
            may find automatic updates confusing because it is not always clear what is
            happening. When a page is refreshed, the screen reader's “virtual cursor",
            which marks the user's current location on the page, is moved to the top of
            the page. People who use screen magnification software and people with
            reading disabilities may also be disoriented when pages are refreshed
            automatically.</p>
          <p>Some content is frequently updated with new data or information. Some
            developers force automatic updates by inserting code in the content that
            causes the content to request a new copy of itself from the server. These
            updates and the frequency of these updates are not always under the user's
            control. Instead of triggering updates automatically, authors can provide a
            mechanism that allows the user to request an update of the content as
            needed.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to provide an audio (spoken) version of information that is provided visually so that it is possible for people who cannot see to be able to understand audio-visual material.</p>
          <p>Since most user agents today cannot merge multiple sound tracks, this technique adds the additional audio information to synchronized media by providing an option which allows users to replace the soundtrack with a new copy of the original soundtrack that has the additional audio description added. This added information focuses on actions, characters, scene changes and on-screen text (not captions) that are important to understanding the content.</p>
          <p>Since it is not helpful to have this new information obscure key audio information in the original sound track (or be obscured by loud sound effects), the new information is added during pauses in dialogue and sound effects. This limits the amount of supplementary information that can be added to the program.</p>
          <p>The soundtrack with the audio description (of visual information) can either be an alternate sound track that the user can choose, or it can be the standard sound track that everyone hears.</p>

          <p>Some users who have difficulty sounding out (decoding) words in written text find it very helpful to hear the text read aloud. This service can now be provided easily using either recorded human speech or synthetic speech. For example, there are a number of products that authors can use to convert text to synthetic speech, then save the spoken version as an audio file. A link to the spoken version can then be provided within the content.  Cost depends in part on the quality of the voice used and whether the text is likely to change frequently.</p>

              <p>Server-based methods may be best when pages change often or when user choice determines text content. Some server-based tools allow users to select any text they are interested in and listen to it. Typically, the user presses a button which starts the text-to-speech conversion and reads the text aloud.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to allow users who cannot hear or read
            text rapidly to be able to access synchronized media material without affecting the
            presentation of the material for all viewers.</p>
          <p>For those who communicate primarily in sign language it is sometimes less
            preferable and sometimes not possible for them to read and understand text
            at the rate it is presented in captions. For these latter individuals it is
            important to provide sign language presentation of the audio information.</p>
          <p>This technique accomplishes this by providing the sign language
            interpretation as a separate video stream that is synchronized with the
            original video stream. Depending on the player, this secondary video stream
            can be overlaid on top of the original video or displayed in a separate
            window. It may also be possible to enlarge the sign language interpreter
            separately from the original video to make it easier to read the hand, body
            and facial movements of the signer.</p>
          <p>NOTE: Since sign language is not usually a signed version of the printed
            language, the author has to decide which sign language to include. Usually
            the sign language of the primary audience would be used. If intended for
            multiple audiences, multiple languages may be used. See advisory technique
            for multiple sign languages.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to notify the user when a field that must be completed has not been completed. When users fail to provide input for any mandatory form fields, information is provided in text to enable the users to identify which fields were omitted. One approach is to use client-side validation and provide an alert dialog box identifying the mandatory fields which were omitted. Another approach, using server-side validation, is to re-display the form (including any  previously entered data), with either a text description at the location of the omitted mandatory field, or a text description that identifies the omitted mandatory fields.</p>
          <note>
            <p>The best practice is to include a message or alert, as some users may not be aware that an error has occurred and could assume that the form is not functioning correctly. It is also best practice to include an error notification in the page title (<el>title</el> element) since a screen reader user is likely to believe the page was submitted correctly and continue to navigate to another page as soon as the new page is returned instead of reading the main content area of the page again.</p>

Using client-side validation, the omission is detected and an alert dialog appears informing the user that mandatory fields have not been completed. The labels of the fields with this problem are changed to identify the problem field, and links to the problem fields are inserted in the document after the submit button so the user can move to them after dismissing the alert.</p>

            <item>

Using server-side validation, the omission is detected and the form is re-displayed with a text description at the top informing which mandatory fields were omitted. Each omitted mandatory field is also identified using a text label so that the user does not have to return to the list at the top of the form to find the omitted fields.</p>

          <p>When users enter input that is validated, and errors are detected, the nature of the error needs to described to the user in manner they can access. One approach is to present an alert dialog that describes fields with errors when the user attempts to submit the form. Another approach, if validation is done by the server, is to return the form (with the user's data still in the fields) and a text description at the top of the page that indicates the fact that there was a validation problem, describes the nature of the problem, and provides ways to locate the field(s) with a problem easily. The "in text" portion of the Success Criterion underscores that it is not sufficient simply to indicate that a field has an error by putting an asterisk on its label or turning the label red. A text description of the problem should be provided.</p>
          <p>When input must be one of a set of allowed values, the text description should indicate this fact. It should include the list of values if possible, or suggest the allowed value that is most similar to the entered value.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to provide assistance in correcting input errors where the information supplied by the user is not accepted. When users enter data input that is validated, and input errors are detected, information about the nature and location of the input error is provided in text to enable the users to identify the problem. One approach is to use client-side validation and provide an alert dialog box that describes the error immediately when users enter invalid data in field. Another approach, using server-side validation, is to re-display the form (including any previously entered data), and a text description at the top of the page that indicates the fact that there was an error, describes the nature of the problem, and provides ways to easily locate the field(s) with a problem.</p>
          <p>However the text description is provided, it should do one of the following things to assist the user:</p>
          <ulist>
            <item>
              <p>Provide examples of the correct data entry for the field,</p>

            <item>
              <p>Describe the correct data entry for the field,</p>
            </item>
            <item>
              <p>Show values of the correct data entry that are similar to the user's data entry, with instructions to the user as to how to enter one of these correct values should the user choose to do so.</p>

            <item>

            <item>
              <p>The user inputs invalid data on a form field and attempts to submit the form. Client side scripting detects the error, cancels the submit, and modifies the document to provide a text description after the submit button describing the error, with links to the field(s) with the error.

          <p>The objective of this technique is to provide a summary of complex content. The summary is provided in addition to the original content.</p>
          <p>Users with disabilities that make it difficult to decode words and sentences are likely to have trouble reading and understanding complex text. This technique provides a short statement of the most important ideas and information in the content. The summary is easier to read because it uses shorter sentences and more common words than the original.</p>
          <p>The following steps can be used to prepare the summary:</p>
          <olist>
            <item>
              <p>Identify the most important ideas and information in the content.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
              <p>Write one or more paragraphs that use shorter sentences and more common words to express the same ideas and information. (The number of paragraphs depends on the length of the original.)</p>

            <description>
              <p>An article describes a technical innovation. The first item after the title of the article is a section with the heading, “Summary." The average length of the sentences in the summary is 16 words (compared to 23 words for sentences in the article), and it uses short, common words instead of the technical jargon in the article.  A readability formula is applied; the summary requires reading ability less advanced than the lower secondary education level.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to provide a way for people who have
            hearing impairments or otherwise have trouble hearing the dialogue in
            synchronized media material to be able to view the material and see the dialogue and
            sounds - without requiring people who are not deaf to watch the captions.
            With this technique all of the dialogue and important sounds are embedded as
            text in a fashion that causes the text not to be visible unless the user
            requests it. As a result they are visible only when needed. This requires
            special support for captioning in the user agent.</p>
          <p>NOTE: Captions should not be confused with subtitles. Subtitles provide text
            of only the dialogue and do not include important sounds.</p>

              <p>Example 1: In order to ensure that users who are deaf can use their
                interactive educational materials, the college provides captions and
                instructions for turning on captions for all of their audio
                interactive educational programs.</p>
              <p>Example 2: The online movies at a media outlet all include
                captions and are provided in a format that allows embedding of
                closed captions.</p>
              <p>Example 3: Special caption files including synchronization
                information are provided for an existing movie. Players are
                available that can play the captions in a separate window on screen,
                synchronized with the movie window.</p>
              <p>Example 4: A video of a local news event has captions provided that

          <p>The objective of this technique is to give each Web page a descriptive title. Descriptive titles help users find content, orient themselves within it, and navigate through it. A descriptive title allows a user to easily identify what Web page they are using and to tell when the Web page has changed. The title can be used to identify the Web page without requiring users to read or interpret page content. Users can more quickly identify the content they need when accurate, descriptive titles appear in site maps or lists of search results. When descriptive titles are used within link text, they help users navigate more precisely to the content they are interested in.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to create a text alternative that serves the same purpose and presents the same information as the original non-text content.  As a result, it is possible to remove the non-text content and replace it with the text alternative and no functionality or information would be lost.   This text alternative should not necessarily describe the non-text content.  It should serve the same purpose and convey the same information.  This may sometimes result in a text alternative that looks like a description of the non-text content.  But this would only be true if that was the best way to serve the same purpose.</p>
          <p>If possible, the short text alternative should completely convey the purpose and information.  If it is not possible to do this in a short phrase or sentence, then the short text alternative should provide a brief overview of the information.  A long text alternative would be used in addition to convey the full information.</p>
          <p>The text alternative should be able to substitute for the non-text content. If the non-text content were removed from the page and substituted with the text, the page would still provide the same function and information. The text alternative would be brief but as informative as possible.</p>
          <p>In deciding what text to include in the alternative, it is a often a good idea to consider the following questions:</p>
          <ulist>
            <item>
              <p>Why is this non-text content here?</p>
            </item>
            <item>
              <p>What information is it presenting?</p>
            </item>
            <item>
              <p>What purpose does it fulfill?</p>
            </item>
            <item>
              <p>If I could not use the non-text content, what words would I use to convey the same function and/or information?</p>
            </item>
          </ulist>
          <p>When non-text content contains words that are important to understanding the content, the alt text should include those words. If the text in the image is more than can fit in a short text alternative then it should be described in the short text alternative and a long text alternative should be provided as well with the complete text.</p>
        </description>
        <examples>
          <ulist>
            <item>
              <p>A search button uses an image of a magnifying glass.  The text alternative is "search" and not "magnifying glass".</p>
            </item>

          <p>This technique is used when the text needed to serve the same purpose and
            present the same information as the original non-text content is too lengthy
            or when this goal cannot be achieved with text alone. In that case this
            technique is used to provide a short text alternative that briefly describes
            the non-text content. (A long text alternative is then provided using
            another technique such that the combination serves the same purpose and
            presents the same information as the original non-text content.)</p>
          <p>In deciding what text to include in the alternative, it is often a good idea
            to consider the following questions:</p>
          <ulist>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to make the expanded form of an abbreviation available by associating the expanded form with its abbreviation the first time it occurs within a Web page. The expansion of any abbreviation can be found by searching the Web page for the first use.</p>
          <p><phrase diff="add">For English, w</phrase><phrase diff="del">W</phrase>hen shortening a word, phrase or name by means of an abbreviation, initialism, acronym, or other shortened form, it is advisable to provide the full form before providing the abbreviated form. This makes the text easier to read and is advised by many style guides.<phrase diff="add"> Other languages may have different conventions.</phrase></p>
          <p>Note that some abbreviations require explanations rather than expansions. This technique is not appropriate for such abbreviations.</p>
          <p>This technique is applied to the first occurrence of an abbreviation in a Web page. When combining multiple resources into a single Web page, the abbreviation would be expanded at the beginning of each resource. In this case, however, using a different technique for providing the expanded form may be more appropriate.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to provide users with a way to ensure their input is correct before completing an irreversible transaction. Testing, financial, and legal applications permit transactions to occur which cannot be "undone". It is therefore important that there be no errors in the data submission, as the user will not have the opportunity to correct the error once the transaction has been committed.</p>
          <p>On a simple, 1-page form this is easy because the user can review the form before submitting. On a form that spans multiple Web pages, however, data is collected from the user in multiple steps before the transaction is committed. The user may not recall all of the data that was entered in previous steps before the step which commits the transaction.</p>
          <p>One approach is to cache the results of each individual step and allow the user to navigate back and forth at will to review all data entered. Another approach is to provide a summary of all data collected in all steps for the user to review prior to the final commitment of the transaction.</p>
          <p>Before the final step that commits the transaction to occur, instructions are provided to prompt the user to review the data entered and confirm. Once the user confirms, the transaction is completed.</p>

          <p>When a Web application provides the capability of deleting information, the server can provide a means to recover information that was deleted in error by a user. One approach is to delay deleting the data by merely marking it for deletion or moving it to a holding area (such as a trash can) and waiting some period of time before actually deleting it. During this time period, the user can request that the data be restored or can retrieve it from the holding area. Another approach is to record all delete transactions in such a way that data can be restored if requested by the user, such as in the edit history stored by wikis and source control applications.The retrievable information that is stored should be that which would be needed to correct the transaction.</p>

            <item>
              <p>A Web application allows users to set up folders and store data within them. Each folder and data item is accompanied by a checkbox to mark it for action, and two buttons, one to move and one to delete. If the user selects the delete button by mistake, large amounts of data could be lost. The application presents the data as deleted to the user right away, but schedules it for actual deletion in one week. During the week, the user may go into a "deleted items" folder and request any folder or data item awaiting actual deletion to be restored.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to provide information necessary to understand an abbreviation.</p>
          <p>An abbreviation is the shortened form of a word, phrase, or name. For most abbreviations, providing the full word, phrase, or name is sufficient.</p>
          <p>Some abbreviations represent words or phrases that are borrowed from a foreign language. For instance, many commonly used abbreviations in English are derived from Latin phrases, such as the short list of examples given below. The expanded form is only provided here as background information. For this category of abbreviations, providing an explanation is more helpful than the original expanded form, and the explanation of the abbreviation is provided instead of the expansion.</p>

          <p>Web servers that require user authentication often terminate the session after a set period of time if there is no activity from the user. If the user is unable to input the data quickly enough and the session times out before they submit, the server will require re-authentication before proceeding. When this happens, the server stores the data in a temporary cache while the user logs in, and when the user has re-authenticated, the data is made available from the cache and the form is processed as if there had never been a session time-out. The server does not keep the cache indefinitely, merely long enough to ensure success after re-authentication in a single user session, such as one day.</p>

The user submits  the reply and is informed of the time out and prompted to log in again to submit the response. The user's post reply is retained by the server and if the user log-in is successful the reply  is processed as normal. If the log-in cannot be successfully completed the reply is discarded.</p>

            <item>
              <p>The user had logged in to a secure area and fills out a form. The session times out for  security reasons. The form data is retained by the server and the user is informed of the time  out and is prompted to log-in again. If the user logs in correctly, the form is presented to the user with all of the data previously entered and user can submit the form. If the log-in cannot be successfully completed the form data is discarded.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to provide a method for activating things that is predictable by the user. Users with cognitive disabilities and people using screen readers or screen magnifiers may be confused by an unexpected event such as automatic form submission or activation of a function that causes a change of context.</p>
          <p>With this technique, all changes of context would be triggered only by a specific action on the part of the user.  Further, that action would be one that usually causes changes in context, such as clicking on a link or pressing a submit button.  Actions that simply move the focus to an element would not cause a change of context.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to allow assistive technology to
            understand Web content so that it can convey equivalent information to the
            user through an alternate user interface and allow them to operate controls
            through the AT.</p>
          <p>This technique involves using standard, documented and supported features to
            expose these properties to AT. It relies on the fact that these standard
            controls in standard browsers meet the requirements.</p>
          <p>For HTML these assumptions are good. They may also be appropriate for some
            other technologies.</p>
          <p>Even when the components support accessibility, it is essential that some
            information be provided by the author. For example, a control may have the
            ability to provide a name but the author still has to provide the name. The
            role attribute however may already be provided since it is a standard
            component with a fixed role.</p>

              <p>Example 1: A Web page written in HTML or XHTML uses standard form
                controls, and identifies the form control using the title attribute.
                The user agent makes information about these controls, including the
                name, available to assistive technology through the DOM and through
                a platform-specific Accessibility API.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to enable redirects on the client side
            without confusing the user. Redirects are preferably implemented on the
            server side (see <loc href="SVR1" linktype="server">Implementing automatic redirects on the server side instead of on the client side</loc>), because a server-side
            redirect does not cause new content to be displayed before the server sends
            the content located at the new URI. However, authors do not always have
            control over server-side technologies; in that case, they can use a
            client-side redirect. A client-side redirect is implemented by code inside
            the content that instructs the user agent to retrieve content from a
            different URI. It is important that the redirecting page or Web page
            only contains information related to the redirect.</p>

        <description>
          <p>The objective of this technique is to mark up the structure of the Web content using the appropriate semantic elements. In other words, the elements are used according to their meaning, not because of the way they appear visually.</p>
          <p>Using the appropriate semantic elements will make sure the structure is available to the user agent. This involves explicitly indicating the role that different units have in understanding the meaning of the content. The nature of a piece of content as a paragraph, header, emphasized text, table, etc. can all be indicated in this way. In some cases, the relationships between units of content should also be indicated, such as between headings and subheadings, or amongst the cells of a table. The user agent can then make the structure perceivable to the user, for example using a different visual presentation for different types of structures or by using a different voice or pitch in an auditory presentation.</p>
          <p>In HTML, for example, phrase-level elements such as
            <code>
              <![CDATA[em]]>
            </code>,
            <code>
              <![CDATA[abbr]]>
            </code>, and
            <code>
              <![CDATA[cite]]>
            </code>
            add semantic information within sentences, marking text for emphasis and identifying abbreviations and citations, respectively. MathML, a markup language designed to maintain important distinctions between structure and presentation in mathematics, includes special "presentation" markup for the complex notations used to represent mathematical ideas as well as "content" (semantic) markup for the mathematical ideas themselves.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to ensure that information conveyed through variations in the formatting of text is conveyed in text as well. When the visual appearance of text is varied to convey information, state the information explicitly in the text. Variations in the visual appearance can be made by changes in font face, font size, underline, strike through and various other text attributes. When these types of variations convey information, that information needs to be available elsewhere in the content via text. Including additional sections in the document or an inline description where the variation in presentation of text occurs can be used to convey the information.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to provide a mechanism to bypass a block of material by skipping to the end of the block. The first link in the block or the link directly preceding the block moves focus to the content immediately after the block. Activating the link advances the keyboard focus past the block. When there are multiple blocks to be skipped, the user skips from block to block via these links.</p>

            <description>
              <p>This example demonstrates both the use of Heading elements at the beginning of each section (H69) and links that skip to the end of each section. This allows people to skip blocks of repeated content using keyboard navigation or using heading navigation, depending on the capabilities of their user agents. Note that some sections of the content are wrapped in a
                <el>div</el>
                element to work around a limitation of Internet Explorer (see the User Agents Notes for Creating HTML links to skip blocks of content (future link)).</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to provide a mechanism to bypass blocks of material by providing a list of links to the different sections of the content. The links in this list, like a small table of contents at the beginning of the content, set focus to the different sections of the content. This technique is particularly useful for pages with many independent sections, such as portals. It may also be combined with other techniques for skipping blocks within a section.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to enable users to identify the relationship between the current Web page and other Web pages in the same collection (e.g., on the same Web site). In some cases this can be done programmatically—for example by using the
            <code>
              <![CDATA[rel]]>
            </code>
            attribute of the

              <![CDATA[link]]>
            </code>
            element in HTML. In other cases the information is provided by including the relevant information in the title of the Web page.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to help orient the user by providing information about the current location via the navigational user interface component. This technique is especially useful when the Web pages are steps in a task that must be processed in order. Providing this indication helps the user to better understand his place in the sequence. The location may be indicated by adding an icon or text, or by changing the state of the item.</p>

              <p>A Web page implements tab panel style navigation. A list of panel tabs is displayed horizontally across the page. The current content is displayed in a panel below the list of panel tabs. When the user navigates to and selects a particular panel tab the content in the panel is updated to reflect the topic of the selected tab. In addition, the background color of the selected tab is changed from the default color and a check mark icon is displayed next to the tab panel text to indicate it is the active panel. The check mark icon includes an appropriate text alternative.</p>

              <p>The navigation bar for a site is implemented as a list of links. The navigation bar appears on all Web pages within a collection of Web pages. As the user gives focus to or hovers over a particular link in the navigation bar the background color of the link is changed. This change in styling on mouseover or focus is specified via the cascading style sheet for the Web page. When focus is removed from the link the style is reset to the normal link style. When the link is activated to change the contents of the page, the selected link within the navigation bar is disabled since the result of following this link is the Web page currently being displayed. Changing the background color gives sighted users visual notification of the link to be selected. Disabling the link provides information to all users that it is the currently selected topic.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to make section headings within Web content descriptive. Descriptive headings and titles (see <loc href="G88" linktype="techniques">Providing descriptive titles for Web pages</loc>) work together to give users an overview of the content and its organization. Descriptive headings identify sections of the content in relation both to the Web page as a whole and to other sections of the same Web page.</p>
          <p>Descriptive headings help users find specific content and orient themselves within the Web page.</p>
          <p>Authors may also want to consider putting the most important information at the beginning of each heading. This helps users “skim" the headings to locate the specific content they need, and is especially helpful when browsers or assistive technology allow navigation from heading to heading.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to avoid ambiguities in Web pages
            that often result from code that does not validate against formal
            specifications. Each technology's mechanism to specify the technology and
            technology version is used, and the Web page is validated against the
            formal specification of that technology. If a validator for that technology
            is available, the developer can use it.</p>
          <p>Validation will usually eliminate ambiguities (and more) because an
            essential step in validation is to check for proper use of that technology's
            markup (in a markup language) or code (in other technologies). Validation
            does not necessarily check for full conformance with a specification but it
            is the best means for automatically checking content against its
            specification.</p>

The alternate page, or conforming alternate version, may make some design or functionality compromises in order to conform, but must meet the requirements described in the definition in order to be a conforming alternate version. The definition of "conforming alternate version" is:</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to combine color and semantic markup to convey information. Most users can quickly scan the content to locate information conveyed by using color. For users who cannot see color, semantic markup can provide a different type of cue. User agents can then make this type of structure perceivable to the user, for example using a different visual presentation for different types of structures or by using a different voice or pitch in an auditory presentation.</p>
          <p>Most user agents will visually distinguish text that has been identified using semantic markup. Some assistive technologies provide a mechanism for determining the characteristics of content that has been created using proper semantic markup.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to help users find input errors where the information supplied by the user is not accepted. This includes fields with missing required information and fields with incorrect information. When users enter data input that is checked, and input errors are detected, a link to that error is provided so that the user does not have to search for it. One approach is to use server-side validation, and to re-display the form (including any previously entered data), and a text description at the top of the page that indicates the fact that there was an input error, describes the nature of the problem, and provides a link the field(s) with a problem.</p>

The text describes the nature of the error(s) and provides a link to the field that had the problem so the user can easily navigate to it to fix the problem.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to facilitate the interaction of assistive technology with content by logically separating the content's structural encoding from the presentational encoding. Structural encoding is the indication of elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, etc., and is done by using technology features reserved for the purpose. By contrast, presentational encoding is the indication of formatting effects, such as typeface, color, size, position, borders, etc., and is also supported by technology features.</p>
          <p>While presentational features visually imply structure — users can determine headings, paragraphs, lists, etc. from the formatting conventions used — these features do not encode the structure unambiguously enough for assistive technology to interact with the page effectively. Providing separate structure, functionality, and presentation layers allows the semantics implied by the formatting to become programmatically determined via the structure layer.</p>

            <description>
              <p>An HTML document uses the structural features of HTML, such as paragraphs, lists, headings, etc., and avoids presentational features such as font changes, layout hints, etc. CSS is used to format the document based on its structural properties. Well-crafted "class" attributes in the HTML extend the semantics of the structural markup if needed to allow more flexible formatting with CSS. Assistive technologies can substitute or extend the CSS to modify presentation, or ignore the CSS and interact directly with the structural encoding.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to ensure that sections have headings that identify them. Success Criterion 1.3.1 requires that the headings be marked such that they can be programmatically identified.</p>
          <p>In HTML, this would be done using the HTML heading elements (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6). These allow user agents to automatically identify section headings. Other technologies use other techniques for identifying headers. To facilitate navigation and understanding of overall document structure, authors should use headings that are properly nested (e.g., h1 followed by h2, h2 followed by h2 or h3, h3 followed by h3 or h4, etc.).</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to make sure that users can read text
            that is presented over a background. This technique relaxes the 4.5:1
            contrast ratio requirement for text that is at least 18 point (if not bold) or at least 14 point (if bold).</p>
          <p>If the background is a solid color (or all black or all white) then the
            contrast ratio of the larger-scale text can be maintained by making sure that each
            of the text letters have a 3:1 contrast ratio with the background.</p>
          <p>If the background or the letters vary in relative luminance (or are patterned), then
            the background around the letters can be chosen or shaded so that the
            letters maintain a 3:1contrast ratio with the background behind them
            even if they do not have that contrast ratio with the entire background.</p>
          <p>The contrast ratio can sometimes be maintained by changing the
            relative luminance of the letters as the relative luminance of the background changes across
            the page.</p>
          <p>Another method is to provide a halo around the text that provides the
            necessary contrast ratio if the background image or color would not
            normally be sufficiently different in relative luminance.</p>

              <p>Larger-scale text is placed over a picture of the college campus. Since a wide variety of colors and darknesses appear in the picture, the area behind the text is fogged white so that the picture is very faint and the maximum darkness is still light enough to maintain a 3:1 contrast ratio with the black text written over the picture.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to be able to present content without introducing horizontal scroll bars by using layout techniques that adapt to the available horizontal space. Liquid layouts define layout regions that both resize with text, and
            reflow as needed to display the region on the screen. Although the exact layout therefore varies, the relationship of elements and the reading order remains the same. This is an effective way to create designs that present well on different devices and for users with different font size preferences.</p>
          <p>The basic principles of liquid layouts are to:</p>
          <olist>
            <item>
              <p>Define the size of layout regions using units that will cause the region to scale relative to text, so they enlarge or shrink as text is enlarged or shrunk;</p>
            </item>
            <item>
              <p>Position the layout regions as a row of adjacent floating boxes, which wrap to new rows as needed in much the same way as words in a paragraph wrap.</p>
            </item>
          </olist>
          <p>Complex liquid layouts may be achieved by nesting layout regions, thus creating localized liquid layouts within a larger liquid layout. Even simple liquid layouts require design finesse to achieve good-looking results at a wide range of text sizes, but well-designed liquid layouts can be the most effective page design.</p>

            <head>Simple liquid layout in HTML and CSS</head>
            <description>
              <p>The following fairly simple example uses HTML and CSS to create a liquid layout. The three columns adjust their size as text size is adjusted. When the total horizontal width exceeds the available width of the columns, the last column wraps to be positioned below, rather than beside, the previous column. The font size can be increased without either clipping or introducing horizontal scrolling until the longest word no longer fits in a column. This particular example uses percent sizes for the columns and defines them as floating regions using the "float" property.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to make sure that users can read text
            that is presented over a background. With this technique the author avoids
            having to do any contrast measures by simply not specifying the text color
            and not specifying the background. As a result the colors of both are
            completely determined by the user agent.</p>
          <p>Some people who have vision disabilities set their user agent to override certain colors that they have trouble seeing. This technique will help avoid a situation where the user agent and web site conflict with each other over the foreground and/or background colors resulting in the same color for text and background, which would make it invisible for user who set their own colors in their browser or Assistive Technology.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to ensure that the focused component can be visually identified by the user by relying on user agent support. It is common for user agents to highlight standard controls in some way when they receive focus. UAAG-conformant user agents do so when they satisfy checkpoint 10.2 "Highlight selection, content focus, enabled elements, visited links". When authors use standard controls for which the user agent provides this support, users are informed of the focus location in a standard, predictable way.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to allow users who cannot hear to be able to access real-time audio broadcasts. It is more difficult to create accurate real-time alternatives because there is little time to correct mistakes, to listen a second time or to consult someone to be sure the words are accurately reproduced. It is also harder to simplify or paraphrase information if it is flowing too quickly.</p>
          <p>Real-time typing text entry techniques exist using stenographic and rapid typing technologies. Re-voicing speech-to-text (where a person listens to speech and then carefully re-voices it into a computer trained to their speech) is used today for telephone relay services and may be used in the future for captioning. Eventually speech-to-text with correction will be possible.</p>

Live audio should not deviate from the script for this technique.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to ensure that animated gif images stop blinking within five seconds. There are three aspects of the design of animated gif images that work together to determine how long the image blinks (or otherwise animates):</p>
          <ulist>
            <item>
              <p>the number of
                <emph role="bold">frames</emph>
                in the image, which are discrete images in the animation sequence;</p>
            </item>
            <item>
              <p>the
                <emph role="bold">frame rate</emph>, which is how long each image is displayed;</p>
            </item>
            <item>
              <p>the number of
                <emph role="bold">repetitions</emph>, which is how many times the entire animation is performed;</p>
            </item>
          </ulist>
          <p>At its simplest, the duration of the animation is the number of frames times the frame rate times the number of repetitions. For example, a simple blinking image with 2 frames, a frame rate of .5 seconds, and 3 repetitions will have a duration of (2 * 0.5 * 3) seconds, or exactly 3 seconds.</p>
          <p>Many animated gif images have a constant frame rate, i.e., the amount of time each frame is displayed is the same. However, it is possible to set a different frame rate for each frame, to allow certain frames to be displayed longer than others. In this case, the duration of the animation is the sum of the frame rates times the number of repetitions. For example, a simple image with two frames, the first of which displays for .75 seconds and the second for .25 seconds, and three repetitions will have a duration of ((.75 + .25) * 3) seconds, also exactly 3 seconds.</p>
          <p>For an image to stop blinking within 5 seconds, one of the three variables must be adjusted. Most commonly, set the number of repetitions to five seconds divided by the product of the number of frames times the frame rate (or by the sum of the frame rate). Truncate this number down to the nearest integer, do not round up to the next integer, to ensure that the image will stop within five seconds.</p>
          <p>If even one repetition results in more than five seconds of animation, one of the other factors must be adjusted. Reduce the number of frames in the image, or increase the frame rate. Be careful when increasing the frame rate that the resulting image does not fail the requirement not to exceed the general flash or red flash thresholds; attention to this is especially important for large images.</p>
        </description>
        <examples>
          <ulist>
            <item>
              <p>
                <emph role="bold">A simple blinking image.</emph>
                An image has 2 frames, a frame rate of .5 seconds, and 3 repetitions. The animation has a duration of (2 * 0.5 * 3) seconds, or exactly 3 seconds, and therefore meets the requirements of the success criterion.</p>

        </examples>
        <tests>

              </item>
              <item>
                <p>Alternatively, use an image editor to determine the number of frames, the frame rate, and the number of repetitions. Calculate the product of the number of frames multiplied by the frame rate times the number of repetitions. If the frame rates are not uniform, calculate the product of the sum of the frame rates multiplied by the number of repetitions.</p>
              </item>
              <item>
                <p>Using either method, the duration of animation should be less than or equal to 5 seconds.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to provide a checkbox that users must select to indicate they have reviewed their input and are ready for it to be committed. This is important when the nature of the transaction is such that it may not be reversible if input errors are subsequently discovered or when the result of an action is that data is deleted. The author provides a checkbox that is not selected when the page loads, with a label like "I confirm that the input is correct and am ready to submit" or "I confirm that I wish to delete this data". The checkbox should be located near the submit button to help the user notice it during the submission process. If the checkbox is not selected when the form is submitted, the input is rejected and the user is prompted to review their entry, select the checkbox, and resubmit. Only if the checkbox is selected will the input be accepted and the transaction processed.</p>
          <p>This checkbox helps to guard against the consequences of an accidental form submission, and also serves to prompt the user to be sure they have entered accurate data. This is more secure than simply putting a label on the submit button like "input is correct, submit". Providing the checkbox as a separate control from the submit button forces the user to "double-check", as they must both select the checkbox and activate the submit button for the transaction to proceed. As such, this is a mechanism for reviewing, confirming, and correcting information before finalizing the submission.</p>
          <note>
            <p>When users submit information without selecting the checkbox, they should not lose the information that they have entered when they return to the form to resubmit.</p>

            <item>
              <p>An online bank service allows users to transfer money between accounts in different currencies. Because exchange rates are constantly in flux, the money cannot be re-exchanged at the same rate if the user discovers an error in their input after the transaction has been carried out. In addition to the "account from", "account to", and "amount" fields, there is a checkbox with a label "I have checked that the amount I wish to transfer is correct". If this checkbox is not selected when the user submits the form, the transaction is not carried out and the user is notified. If the checkbox is selected, the (irreversible) transaction is carried out.</p>

            <item>
              <p>An online payment system stores user bank account information in order to process payments. There is an elaborate procedure for users to enter new accounts and verify that they are the owner. There is the facility to delete old accounts, but if an account is accidentally deleted, it would be difficult to reinstate it, and the transaction history with that account would be lost. Therefore, on pages that allow users to delete accounts, there is a checkbox with the label "I confirm that I wish to delete this account." If this checkbox is not selected when the user submits the form, the account is not deleted and the user is given an error message. Only if the checkbox is selected is the account deleted.</p>

              <p>A checkout form on a shopping site includes a form that collects order, shipping and billing information. After submitting the form, the user is taken to a page where the information they have submitted is summarized for review. Below the summary, a checkbox with the label "I have reviewed and confirmed that this data is correct" is shown. The user must mark the checkbox and activate a "complete order" button in order to complete the transaction.</p>

          <p>Some people with cognitive disabilities require specific color combinations of foreground text and background to help them successfully understand the contents of the Web page. Most popular browsers provide the option to change colors settings globally within the browser. In this case the colors selected by the user override the foreground and background colors specified by the Web author.</p>
          <p>In order to meet this success criteria, the Web author would design the page so that it works with browsers that have these controls, and the author does not override these controls.</p>
          <p>Note that overriding the foreground and background colors of all text on a page may hide visual clues to the grouping and organization of the Web page, making it much more difficult to understand and use. This technique may not be appropriate when background colors are used to delineate areas of the page. This technique may be appropriate for technologies and user agents that do not alter border colors when background colors are overridden. If background colors are used to delineate areas of the page, "<loc href="C23" linktype="css">Specifying text and background colors of secondary content such as banners, features and navigation in CSS while not specifying text and background colors of the main content</loc>" may be used to permit the user to control the colors of the main text while retaining the visual structure of the Web page.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to use a real-time caption service to provide a text version of live audio content. Such services use a trained human operator who listens in to what is being said and uses a special keyboard to enter the text with only a small delay. They are able to capture a live event with a high degree of fidelity, and also to insert notes on any non spoken audio which is essential to understanding the event. The viewport containing the caption text is available on the same Web page as the live audio content.</p>

          <p>The purpose of this technique is to provide an accessible alternative way of presenting the information in an audio-only presentation.</p>
          <p>In an audio-only presentation, information is presented in a variety of ways including dialogue and sounds (both natural and artificial). In order to present the same information in accessible form, this technique involves creating a document that tells the same story and presents the same information as the prerecorded audio-only content. In this technique, the document serves as long description for the content and includes all of the important dialogue and as well as descriptions of background sounds etc. that are part of the story.</p>
          <p>If an actual script was used to create the audio-only content in the first place, this can be a good place to start. In production and editing however, the content often varies somewhat from the script. For this technique, the original script would be corrected to match the dialogue and what actually happens in the final edited form of the audio presentation.</p>

              <p>A podcast includes a description of new features in a recent software release. It involves two speakers informally discussing the new and updated features and describing how they are used. One of the speakers works from a list of questions that was used to outline the discussion prior to recording. After the recording is complete, the outline is then edited and supplemented to match the dialogue etc. The resulting transcript is then made available on the speakers Web site along with the audio-only file. The text alternative that identifies the audio only content reads, "Episode 42: Zap Version 12 (text transcript follows)" and the link to the transcript is provided immediately following the audio-only content.</p>

          <p>The purpose of this technique is to provide an accessible alternative way of presenting the information in an video-only presentation.</p>
          <p>In a video-only presentation, information is presented in a variety of ways including animation, text or graphics, the setting and background, the actions and expressions of people, animals, etc. In order to present the same information in accessible form, this technique involves creating a document that tells the same story and presents the same information as the prerecorded video-only content. In this technique, the document serves as a long description for the content and includes all of the important information as well as descriptions of scenery, actions, expressions, etc. that are part of the presentation.</p>
          <p>If a screenplay for the video-only content was used to create the content in the first place, this can be a good place to start. In production and editing however, the final version often varies somewhat from the screenplay. To use the screenplay, it would need to be corrected to match the final edited form of the video-only presentation.</p>

              <p>An animation shows how to assemble a woodworking project. There is no audio, but the animation includes a series of numbers to represent each step in the process as well as arrows and picture-in-picture highlights illustrating how the assembly is completed. It also includes short outtake animations illustrating what will happen if assembly is done incorrectly. A text alternative that identifies the video-only content reads, "Breadbox assembly video (text description follows)," and the text description of the video includes a full text description of each step in the video.</p>

          <p>For some people who are deaf or have certain cognitive disabilities, sign language may be their first language. A sign language version of the page may be easier for them to understand than a written language version. The objective of this technique is to provide sign language versions of content that help signing users understand difficult text that describes concepts or processes. The sign language content is provided in addition to the text.</p>
          <p>Since this is supplemental content (and not sign language for speech in content) it should be viewed as separate from the content and would not necessarily be synchronized. Although there may be occasions when that would be useful, it is not required.</p>
          <p>To make the sign language version available with the rest of the Web page contents, the video may be embedded in the Web page directly or the Web page may include a link that brings up a video player in a separate window. The sign language version could also be provided via a link to a separate Web page that displays the video.</p>
          <p>Sign language is a three-dimensional, visual language that uses the hands, arms, shoulders, head, face, lips and tongue of the signer. For viewers to understand what is being signed, the video must record the sign language completely. Generally speaking, the signer should be as close to the camera as possible without risking cut-offs (such as hands moving outside the video).</p>
          <p>Information on how to find sign language interpreters is listed in the resources section below.</p>
          <note>
            <p>If the video stream is too small, the sign language interpreter will be indiscernible. When creating a video stream that includes a video of a sign language interpreter, make sure there is a mechanism to play the video stream full screen in the accessibility-supported content technology. Otherwise, be sure the interpreter portion of the video is adjustable to the size it would be had the entire video stream been full screen.</p>
            <p>Since sign language is not usually a signed version of the printed language, the author has to decide which sign language to include. Usually the sign language of the primary audience would be used. If intended for multiple audiences, multiple sign languages may be used. Refer to advisory techniques for multiple sign languages.</p>

          <p>Providing a search function that searches your Web pages is a design strategy that offers users a way to find content. Users can locate content by searching for specific words or phrases, without needing to understand or navigate through the structure of the Web site. This can be a quicker or easier way to find content, particularly on large sites.</p>
          <p>Some search companies offer sites free access to their search applications. Search engines are available that can be installed on your own server. Some web hosting companies offer search scripts that customers can include on their web pages. Most services also offer paid versions of their tools with more advanced features.</p>
          <p>Implementing a search function that will spell-check the terms, include different endings for the terms (stemming), and allow for the use of different terminology (synonyms) will further increase the accessibility of the search function.</p>
          <p>The search functionality is added by either including a simple form on the Web page, usually a text field for the search term and a button to trigger the search or by adding a link to a page that includes a search form. The search form itself must be accessible, of course.</p>
          <p>Techniques that are used to optimize search engine results for external searches also support internal search engines and make them more effective: use keywords,
            <code>
              <![CDATA[META]]>
            </code>
            tags, and an accessible navigation structure. Search sites provide guidance on how to create content that is optimized for search, for instance

            <description>
              <p>A shopping site organizes its products into different categories, such as women's clothes, men's clothes, and children's clothes. These have subcategories, such as tops, pants, shoes, and accessories. Each page also contains a search form. Users can type the product number or product description into the search field and go directly to that product, rather than needing to navigate the product categories to find it.</p>

          <p>When labels for form fields are positioned where the user expects them visually, it is easier to understand complex forms and to locate specific fields. Labels for most fields are positioned immediately before the field, that is, for left-to-right languages, either to the left of the field or above it, and for right-to-left languages, to the right of the field or above it. Labels for radio buttons and checkboxes are positioned after the field.</p>
          <p>These positions are defined because that is the usual (and therefore most predictable) position for the label for fields, radiobuttons and checkboxes.</p>
          <p>Labels are positioned before input fields since the fields sometimes vary in length. Positioning them before allows the labels to line up. It also makes labels easier to locate with a screen magnifier since they are immediately before the field and also can be found in a vertical column (when the start of the fields line up vertically). Finally, if the field has data in it, it is easier to understand or check the data if one reads the label first and then the content rather than the other way around.</p>
          <p>Checkboxes and radio buttons have a uniform width while their labels often do not. Having the radio button or checkbox first therefore allows both the buttons and the labels to line up vertically.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to provide users with a mechanism for turning standard diacritical marks on or off.</p>
          <p>Many languages use diacritical marks or diacritics to indicate the pronunciation of words or to help distinguish between words. Some languages may use diacritics to denote vowels, to indicate consonant doubling, to indicate the absence of a vowel or a consonant, or for other purposes. Although text without such diacritics can be readable, the addition of diacritics can improve readability.</p>

            <description>
              <p>A Web page in Hawaiian displays all diacritical marks by default and provides links that allow users to select the level of display of diacritical marks:</p>
              <ulist>
                <item>
                  <p>Display no diacritical markings</p>
                </item>
                <item>
                  <p>Use the footmark (‘) for the ʻokina, but do not display macrons</p>
                </item>
                <item>
                  <p>Show all diacritical markings</p>
                </item>
              </ulist>
              <p>The visitor selects the level he or she prefers, and this preference is stored into a session cookie. All subsequent pages during that same session have access to the cookie, and show or hide diacritics according to the selected level.</p>
              <p>On the server side, content is stored with all diacritical markings. If a visitor prefers fewer or no diacritics, a server-side function replaces or removes diacritics as desired before sending the response.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to allow users to recover from errors made when placing an order by providing them with a period of time during which they can cancel or change the order. In general, a contract or an order is a legal commitment and cannot be canceled. However, a Web site may choose to offer this capability, and it provides a way for users to recover from errors.</p>
          <p>The Web content would need to tell the user how long the cancellation period is after submitting the form and what the procedure would be to cancel the order. The cancellation procedure may not be possible online. It may, for instance, require written notice be sent to an address listed on the Web page.</p>
          <p>After submitting the form, the user is informed of the length of the cancellation period and the procedure for canceling the transaction. It's best to provide the cancellation procedure at the same website where the transaction was submitted so that it is as easy to cancel as it was to submit and to accommodate users who may be unable to use other mechanisms. But, if necessary, the cancellation procedure may be provided through some other mechanism or combination of mechanisms as long as it has equivalent cross-disability accessibility. In this case, users are warned prior to submitting the form that they will not be able to cancel their order online.</p>

          <p>Operating systems have a native indication of focus, which is available in many user agents. The default rendering of the focus indicator isn't always highly visible and may even be difficult to see against certain backgrounds. However, many platforms allow the user to customize the rendering of this focus indicator. Assistive technology can also change the appearance of the native focus indicator. If you use the native focus indicator, any system-wide settings for its visibility will carry over to the Web page. If you draw your own focus indicator, for example by coloring sections of the page in response to user action, these settings will not carry over, and AT will not usually be able to find your focus indicator.</p>

          <p>When a button invokes a function on an input field, has a clear text label, and is rendered adjacent to the input field, the button also acts as a label for the input field. This label helps users understand the purpose of the field without introducing repetitive text on the Web page. Buttons that label single text fields typically follow the input field.</p>
          <note>
            <p>The field must also have a programmatically determined name, per

              <p>A user in the United States must fill in a form. Since the laws and requirements are different in different states within the United States, the user must select the version of a form for his state of residence. A dropdown list allows the user to pick a state. The adjacent button is labeled "Get Form for State." Pressing the button takes the user to the Web page containing the form for the selected state.</p>

          <p>This technique is to seek confirmation from the user that the selected action is his or her intended action. Use this technique in situations where the action can not be undone after it has been followed through. This will help users avoid submitting a form or deleting data by mistake.</p>
          <p>For example, this may occur when the user expects the 'submit' and 'cancel' buttons to occur in an order contrary to what is provided and selects a button too quickly to notice the unexpected order. Presenting the user with a confirmation request allows the user to recognize the error and either stop the submission of data or stop the loss of entered data.</p>
          <p>The request for confirmation should inform the user of the action that was selected and the consequences of continuing with the action.</p>

              <p>An online travel Web site lets users create travel itineraries that reserve seats with different airlines. Users may look up, amend and cancel their current itineraries. If the user needs to cancel his travel plans, he finds the itinerary on the Web page and deletes it from his list of current itineraries. This action results in the cancellation of his seat reservations and is not reversible. The user is informed that the selected action will cancel their current seat reservations and that it may not be possible to make a comparable booking on the same flights once this action has been taken. The user is asked to confirm or cancel the deletion of the itinerary.</p>

              <p>A Webmail application stores a user's email on a server, so that it can be accessed from anywhere on the web. When a user deletes an email message, it is moved to a trash folder from which it can be retrieved if it was deleted by accident. There is an "empty trash" command for deleting the messages in the trash folder from the server. Once the trash folder has been emptied, the messages can no longer be retrieved. Before emptying the trash folder, the user is asked to confirm or cancel deletion of the email in the trash folder.</p>

          <p>Many people with cognitive disabilities have a great deal of trouble with blocks of text that are justified (aligned to both the left and the right margins). The spaces between words create "rivers of white" running down the page, which can make the text difficult for some people to read. This failure describes situations where this confusing text layout occurs. The best way to avoid this problem is not to create text layout that is fully justified.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to provide a second version of video content that provides audio desciptions so that it is possible for people who cannot see to be able to understand audio-visual material.</p>
          <p>Since most user agents today cannot merge multiple sound tracks, this technique adds the additional audio information to synchronized media by providing a second version of the movie where the original soundtrack and additional audio description have been combined in a single track. This additional information focuses on actions, characters, scene changes and on-screen text (not captions) that are important to understanding the content.</p>
          <p>Since it is not helpful to have this new information obscure key audio information in the original sound track (or be obscured by loud sound effects), the new information is added during pauses in dialogue and sound effects. This limits the amount of supplementary information that can be added to program.</p>
          <p>Providing a second version of the movie that includes audio descriptions as the primary sound track will make this content accessible for blind people who need to hear not only the dialogue, but also the context and other aspects of the video that are not communicated by the characters' dialogue alone.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to include a control on a Web page or set of Web pages that allows users to specify preferred foreground and background colors for the content. This technique can be implemented using any technology that allows users to store preferences that can be used across pages. Using this technique, an author includes a color picker control on the site which allows users to select and save foreground and background color preferences for use on other pages in a site. Pages are designed to look for these preferences and adapt accordingly when saved settings are found.</p>
          <p>Many users with cognitive disabilities have trouble with standard black text on a white background. Sometimes, they can read the text a lot better using different colors for the text and background and sometimes these color combinations are very specific and not what would be expected by someone else (for instance brown on blue).</p>
          <p>Some of these users will have difficulty setting colors using the browser's color settings or the operating systems color settings. Providing a tool on the web page that provides a wide range of foreground and background colors will allow them to easily change the colors without digging into the browser settings.</p>

          <p>The purpose of this technique is to provide an easy way to pass the success criterion for things that flash, but are small.</p>
          <p>If you have something that flashes
            <emph>more</emph>
            than 3 times in a one second period (so G19 can't be used), but the area that is flashing is less than 25% of 10 degrees of visual field (which represents the central area of vision in the eye), then it would automatically pass.</p>
          <p>The 10 degree of visual field represents the central area of vision in the eye. This area is highly packed with visual sensors. Flashes in this area are transmitted to the visual cortex. For those with photosensitivity, this flashing of activity on the visual cortex can cause seizures. Flashing on other areas of the eye (which have far fewer sensors) has much less effect on the cortex. Hence, the focus on just the 10 degrees of central vision.</p>

          <p>Most Web authors do not know how to translate visual field to pixels, which is what they generally can deal with. This technique provides that translation.</p>
          <p>At this point in time, the most prevalent display is 1024 x 768 and about 15-17 inches diagonally. When viewed at a typical viewing distance (22-26 inches) a 10 degree visual field will capture an area approximately 341 x 256 pixels. This is not circular, but neither is the central vision of most users, and the difference is so small (and at the edge of the central vision where sensors are fewer) that it is not important.</p>
          <p>Since the criterion is 25% of any 10 degree visual field,
            <emph role="bold">any single flashing event on a screen (there is no other flashing on screen) that is smaller than a contiguous area of 21,824 sq pixels (any shape), would pass the General and Red Flash Thresholds</emph>.</p>
          <p>1024 x 768 was chosen because it represents the most common screen size. It also works with higher resolution screens since the tighter pixel density would result in a smaller and safer image size.</p>
          <p>Users with lower resolution displays or that enlarge or view their screens closely would have a higher risk depending on the viewing distance. To address the needs of this group,
            <specref ref="G19"/>
            should be used since it is independent of screen resolution or viewing distance.</p>

            <p>For a number of reasons (distribution of central vision sensors often non-circular, simplicity, computational convenience, historical), a 4:3 rectangular approximation of the central 10 degree of visual field is used that is 10 degrees wide and 7.5 degrees high. This has an area of 75 square degrees, vs the 78.5 square degree area of a true circle of 10 degrees.</p>

Using the size and resolution of the display and the closest distance that a person can stand when viewing the display, they calculate the size of 25% of the 10 degree of central vision in pixels (using the formula above). This would be the

          <p>The purpose of this technique is to provide a mechanism on the Web page to incrementally increase the size of text. Many people with low vision do not use magnifying software, and they may not be familiar with browsers text size adjustments. This may be particularly true of older people who are learning about computers later in life and who may be experiencing age related vision loss. It may also be true of some people with cognitive disabilities who also require increased font size.</p>
          <p>This technique provides a mechanism that some users will find easier to use. The mechanism may include links or buttons that will switch the visual presentation to a different style sheet or use scripts to change the text size dynamically.</p>
          <p>To implement this technique, an author provides controls that allow the user to incrementally increase or decrease the text size of all of the text on the page to a size that is at least 200% of the default text size.</p>
          <p>This can be achieved by providing links, buttons or linked images and the controls themselves should be as easy to find (ex. prominently positioned within the page, presented in a larger text size, hight contrast, etc.) as possible.</p>
          <p>This technique can also be used in circumstances where scalable fonts cannot be used, such as legacy code situtions.</p>

          <p>Some user agents support changing the size of text without changing other dimensions of the text container. Loss of content or functionality can occur when the text overflows the space that was allocated for it. However, the layout properties may provide a way to continue to display the content effectively. The block sizes may be defined wide enough that the text does not overflow when resized by 200%. Text may wrap when it no longer fits within the block, and the block may be tall enough that all the text continues to fit in the block. The block may provide scrollbars when the resized text no longer fits.</p>

            <head>A multi-column page layout</head>
            <description>
              <p>HTML and CSS are used to create a two-column layout for a page of text. Using the default value of the
                <code><![CDATA[white-space]]></code>
                property,
                <code><![CDATA[normal]]></code>, causes text to wrap. So as the size of the text is increased to 200%, the text reflows and the column of text grows longer. If the column is too long for the viewport, the user agent provides scrollbars so the user can scroll text into view because the author has specified the CSS rule
                <code><![CDATA[overflow:scroll]]></code>
                or
                <code><![CDATA[overflow:auto]]></code>.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to give people with disabilities enough time to complete tasks which may take them longer than someone without those challenges. Some mechanism such as a preference setting or a control on the page lets the user change the time limits to at least 10 times the default time limit. Preferably, the mechanism would have a variable adjustment that lets the user change the time limit to any value in its range, but could also provide ways to change the time limit by discrete increments. The user changes the time limit at the beginning of his session, before any activity that has a time limit.</p>

        <description>
          <p>Web servers that require user authentication often terminate the session after a set period of time if there is no activity from the user. If the user is unable to input the data quickly enough and the session times out before they submit, the server will require re-authentication before proceeding. When this happens, the server passes (as hidden data) the information from the form into the page that is used for re-authentication. Then, when the user re-authenticates, the server can use the information passed on from the re-authentication page to submit the form directly or to present a page that includes the data that is to be submitted for review. In this technique, the server does not have to store any user-submitted data on server. This is an important technique for those cases where it is either illegal or a security risk for the server to store information temporarily. It also is useful in that it frees the server from having to maintain the stored information and reconnect it with the newly authenticated session.</p>
          <note>
            <p>If the data users are submitting is sensitive or presents a security risk, authors should consider the process used to pass the data to the re-authentication page and, after re-authentication, to the page that will process the original data in order to ensure that the data is protected.</p>

              <p>A user has logged in to use a wiki and begins editing a page. The time taken to complete the edits exceeds the time allowed by the server for session inactivity. When the user submits the edits, the user is notified that the session has timed out and is redirected to a login page. The script that handles the original form submission passes the edits as a variable to the login page and when the user successfully logs in, passes the users edits back to the script that handles form submissions and the edits are processed as though no session timeout had occurred.</p>

            <item>
              <p>A user had logged in to a secure shopping site and fills out some of the information on an order form. For security reasons, the session times out after 30 mintues, but the user does not submit the form until 45 minutes after loading the page. The user is informed of the time out and is prompted to log-in again. If the user logs in correctly, the order form is presented to the user with all of the data previously entered and the user is able to review their submission and submit the form. If the log-in is not successfully completed, then the form data is discarded by the server.</p>

          <p>The intent of this technique is to provide a redundant visual cue for users who may not be able to discern a difference in text color. Color is commonly used to indicate the different status of words that are part of a paragraph or other block of text or where special characters or graphics cannot be used to indicate which words have special status. For example, scattered words in text may be hypertext links that are marked as such by being printed in a different color. This technique describes a way to provide cues in addition to color so that users who may have difficulty perceiving color differences or have low vision can identify them.</p>
          <p>To use this technique, an author incorporates a visual cue in addition to color for each place where color alone is used to convey information. Visual cues can take many forms including changes to the font style, the addition of underlines, bold, or italics, or changes to the font size.</p>
          <note>
            <p>While this technique is sufficient to meet the visual requirements of Success Criterion 1.4.1, the information conveyed by the color must also be available programmatically to satisfy Success Criterion 1.3.1. See

        <description>
          <p>The intent of this technique is to provide a redundant visual cue for users who may not be able to discern a difference in text color. Color is commonly used to indicate words that are links within a paragraph or other block of text. For example, scattered words in text may be hypertext links that are identified only by a difference in color with surrounding text. This technique describes a way to provide additional cues on hover and focus so that users who may have difficulty perceiving color differences or have low vision can identify them.</p>
          <p>With this technique, a
            <loc href="relativeluminancedef" linktype="glossary">relative luminance</loc>
            (lightness) difference of 3:1 or greater with the text around it can be used if additional visual confirmation is available when a user points or tabs to the link. Visual highlights may, for example, take the form of underline, a change in font style such as bold or italics, or an increase in font size.</p>
          <p>While using this technique is sufficient to meet this success criteria, it is not the preferred technique to differentiate link text. This is because links that use the relative luminance of color alone may not be obvious to people with black/white color blindness. If there are not a large number of links in the block of text, underlines are recommended for links.</p>
          <note>
            <p>This technique is about the use of color in addition to luminosity. In this technique, the contrast ratio refers to the contrast between a link and the words around it. In Success Criterion 1.4.3 and 1.4.6, contrast ratio refers to the contrast between a word and its background. The difference is that  this technique is about the ability for users to tell the difference (a noticeable difference) between different pieces of text whereas the contrast ratio used in success criterion 1.4.3 and 1.4.6 is about the readability of the text with its background for different color and vision disabilities.</p>
            <p>If an author wants to use the color portion of this technique (i.e., using different colors for the words where the colors have sufficient contrast with each other) and the author also wants to conform to SC 1.4.3 (contrast of both words with their backgrounds) the following colors can be used. (e.g., black text in a paragraph on a white background with the links shown as one of the colors in the list below.)</p>
            <p>If assistive technology or Web browsers at some point all provide an option to underline all links on Web pages for users, this could be used instead of an author-provided link highlighting mechanism.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to help the user avoid input errors by informing them ahead of time about restrictions on the format of data that they must enter. Instructions on such restrictions are provided at the top of forms. This technique works best for forms that have a small number of fields or those where many form fields require data in the same format. In these cases, it is more efficient to describe the format once in instructions at the top of the form rather than repeating the same information for each field that has the same restricted format requirement.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to provide the user a control that allows him to stop moving or blinking content. Since the control is in the web page, the control itself meets the appropriate level of WCAG conformance e.g., it has appropriate contrast, it has a name that identifies it, it is keyboard accessible. The control is either at the top of the page or adjacent to the moving content. A single control may stop all moving or blinking content on the page, or there may be separate controls for separate parts of the content.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to ensure that blinking content can be turned off using user agent features. User agents allow users to stop animation of content in certain technologies. When the user activates this feature, all animation, including blinking, is stopped.<phrase diff="add"> This feature can be provided either through interactive controls that conform to WCAG or through documented keyboard shortcuts.</phrase></p>
          <p>The most common way for users to stop animation is to press the "escape" key. As long as there are no processes that take precedence in the event queue for a press of that key, this is taken as a command to stop animation of moving or blinking content.</p>

          <p>Many people with cognitive disabilities have trouble reading text that is single spaced. A button that increases the line height will help them read the content. In order to retain the separation of paragraphs, the space between paragraphs should also increase so that it is at least 1.5 times as high as the line spacing.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to provide the user with a control near the beginning of the page that takes the user to a conforming alternate version of the Web page where the link text alone of each link is sufficient to determine its purpose out of context.</p>
          <p>Some users prefer to have links that are self-contained, where there is no need to explore the context of the link. Other users find including the context information in each link to be repetitive and to reduce their ability to use a site. Among users of assistive technology, the feedback to the working group on which is preferable has been divided. This technique allows users to pick the approach that works best for them. Users who need or prefer potentially longer but complete link text use this version.</p>
          <p>If the control for switching to the alternate version is a link, it must always be possible to understand the purpose of the control directly from its link text.</p>
          <p>This technique provides the alternate version for the current page view. It is also possible, and in some cases would be advisable, to save this preference in a cookie or server-side user profile, so that users would only have to make the selection once per site and would automatically be taken to their preferred version.</p>

          <p>It is better for all objects on a page to conform, but there are certain circumstances where that may not be possible. There may be situations when an object or section of content targets people with certain disabilities while those same attributes make it inaccessible for someone else. There may also be other reasons not to have a conforming object on the Web page. When an object does not conform, then a link to a conforming alternate version is adjacent to the non-conforming object in the linear reading order or is associated with the the non-conforming content. The conforming alternate version conveys the same information as the non-conforming version.</p>

          <p>This is a general technique for allowing people who cannot use a page with blinking content to turn the blinking content off.
            <loc href="cc1" linktype="guideline">Conformance Requirement 1</loc>
            allows for conforming alternate pages to be used to meet conformance. This technique is an example of that approach applied to success criteria 2.2.2.</p>
          <p>It is important that the page without blinking content contain all of the information that was on the page with blinking content.</p>
          <note>
            <p>Removing the content that was blinking from the page would only be satisfactory if the blinking content was redundant with non blinking content in the original page.</p>
            <p>This technique can be used in combination with a style switching technique to present a page that is a

          <p>In this technique spell checking and suggestions for text are provided. Often people with cognitive disabilities have trouble spelling a word, but may be able to get the spelling approximately correct. A spell checking program will save them time-consuming research on how to spell the word. This may also be true for blind and low vision users who might make a mistake when typing. It will also help people with dexterity disabilities who may be using a head pointer, or who may have scanning software which makes it very slow and difficult to type. A spell-checking solution that provides word suggestion(s) and a simple mechanism to select one and input it into the text input field provides important help for these users and others.</p>

              <p>A search engine has a form field for search terms. When the form is submitted, a server-side application checks the spelling. If the spelling doesn't match any words for that language, it sends back a page with a text message at the top saying "Did you mean ..." with a link to the suggested word. If the user clicks on the link the suggested term is entered into the form field and is resubmitted.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is enhance the focus indicator in the browser, by creating a highly visible one in the content. The default focus indicator in many browsers is a thin,dotted, black line. It can be difficult to see the line when it is around a form element which already has an outline, when the focused element is inside a table cell, when the focused element is very small, or when the background of the page is a dark color.</p>
          <p>In this technique, when the user places focus on an element, using the mouse, tab key, arrow keys, keyboard shortcuts, or any other method, the application makes that focus more visible, using a combination of a highly contrasting color, a thick line, and other visual indicators such as a glow.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to avoid unnecessary duplication that occurs when a grouping of adjacent non-text content is used to present information or functionality.</p>
          <p>In some cases, pages will present a group of images to convey information. When presented together or in a specific combination these groupings can convey different types of information. For example, two images of a star where one is presented in black and white and the other is colored can be used in combination to represent a user rating. For example, three filled stars followed by two unfilled stars might represent a rating of three out of five stars.</p>
          <p>To use this technique, an author provides a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose for the entire group and associates it with one item in the group. The other items in the group are then marked in a way that can be ignored by assistive technologies. In this way, the user is able to more efficiently identify the purpose of the group and can avoid duplication or confusion that may result had a text alternative been provided for each item in the group.</p>

While a text alternative could have been provided for each of the five images, the author has instead provided the rating in the form "3 out of 5 stars" for the first image and has marked the others using null alt text.</p>

If there are different labels on user interface components (i.e., elements, links, JavaScript objects, etc.) that have the same function, the user will not know that they have encountered a component with the same function and will not know what to expect. This could lead to many unnecessary errors. It is also recommended that this approach to consistent labelling be applied across the Web site.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to provide a mechanism for people who cannot complete tasks within a specified time limit to turn off the time limit.</p>
          <p>It is essential that the mechanism for turning off the time limit can be completed without a time limit itself and before the time limit for the page expires. To do this - the mechanism should be available at or near the top of the page so that it can be found and activated quickly by people with a wide range of disabilities.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to reduce the effort required for users to confirm that an action, such as submitting a Web form, was completed successfully. This can be accomplished by providing consistently presented feedback that explicitly indicates success of an action, rather than requiring a user to navigate through content to discover if the action was successful.</p>
          <p>Significant effort can be expended by users who can not easily scan through information to confirm their action (such as that data submitted has been successfully entered into a database, sent to a person, or added to content being edited).</p>

              <p>A user logs into a system and gets a response indicating that: "You have successfully logged in," so they do not need to navigate through the screen to find an indicator that they are logged in, such as finding their user name, or perhaps the login link replaced with a logout link. Finding these cues can be time consuming.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
              <p>A user fills in a quiz or test and submits it. The response informs them that the test was successfully submitted, so that they don't need to navigate through data, such as a list of submitted tests, to confirm that the test is listed there.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
              <p>A visitor creates an account on a Web site. After submission of the form, feedback suggests that "Registration was successfully submitted ...," If they are automatically logged in after registration, the response also says "...and you have been logged in." If confirmation is required, the feedback includes a message such as "...an email has been sent to you to which you must reply to confirm your registration."</p>
            </item>
            <item>
              <p>A user submits a form with information directed at support staff. The feedback indicates that the "The message was successfully sent, and you should receive a reply within the next 48 hours."</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to limit the use of links or  buttons that open new windows or tabs within Web content. In general,  it is better not to open new windows and tabs since they can be  disorienting for people, especially people who have difficulty  perceiving visual content. However there are some situations where it  is preferable from an accessibility perspective to open a new window or  tab. Here are two such situations:</p>
          <olist>
            <item>
              <p>Opening a page containing context-sensitive information, such  as help instructions, or an alternate means of completing a form, such  as a calendar-based date picker, will significantly disrupt a  multi-step workflow, such as filling in and submitting a form, if the  page is opened in the same window or tab.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
              <p>The user is logged into a secured site, and following a  link to a page outside of the secured scope would terminate the user's  logon. In this case opening external links in an external window allows  the user to access such references while keeping their login active in  the original window.</p>
            </item>
          </olist>
          <p>It is recommend that when links are opened to a new window, there is advance warning.</p>
        </description>
        <examples>
          <eg-group>
            <head>Online Form</head>
            <description>
              <p>An online form provides extensive context-sensitive help for each  form field on a separate page because there is too much text to include  within the form. The links to the context-sensitive help open in new  windows or tabs to prevent the loss of any form data that has already  been entered.</p>

              <p>A page on a secure Web site includes a link to an external page that  is outside of the secure session. The link opens in a new window or tab  since opening the link in the same window will break or destroy the  secure session.</p>

              <p>An online form includes a date field that allows the user to  manually type in the date or select a date from a calendar-based date  picker on a separate page. The link to the calendar-based date picker  opens in a new window or tab to prevent the loss of any form data that  has already been entered.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to provide a warning before automatically
            opening a new window or tab. Opening new windows automatically when
            a link is activated can be disorienting for people who have difficulty
            perceiving visual content, and for some people with cognitive disabilities,
            if they are not warned in advance. Providing a warning allows the user
            to decide it they want to leave the current window, and the warning
            will help them find their way back, if they do decide they would like
            to go to the new window. It will help them understand that the "back" button
            will not work and that they have to return to the last window they
            had open, in order to find their previous location.</p>

          <p>The objective of this technique is to provide keyboard operation for all the functionality of the page. When all functionality of content can be operated through a keyboard or keyboard interface, it can be operated by those with no vision as well as by those who must use alternate keyboards or input devices that act as keyboard emulators like speech input software or on-screen keyboards.</p>
          <p>To implement this technique, first determine what functionality is available to users on the page. In this step, it is important to consider functions performed using both the mouse and the keyboard together. Examples of functionality include the use of physical controls such as links, menus, buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons and form fields as well as the use of features like drag and drop, selecting text, resizing regions or bringing up context menus. Other examples of functionality may based on tasks such as adding or removing an item from a shopping cart or initiating a chat session with a sales representative.</p>
          <p>Once the functionality of the content has been determined, the author verifies that each of the functions identified can be performed using only the keyboard.</p>
          <note>
